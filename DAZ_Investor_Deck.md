## SLIDE 2: The Problem

### Headline
# 99% Waste in Manual Due Diligence

### Key Points

**The Current Reality:**

- **Manual Data Gathering:** 99% of time spent manually collecting, verifying, and cross-referencing data from multiple sources
- **High Risk Profile:** Lack of centralization leads to errors, delays, and cost overruns that derail projects
- **No Automation:** Critical decisions rely on outdated "paper maps" instead of real-time intelligence

**The Cost:**
- Weeks of manual due diligence per project
- High error rates from human oversight
- Missed opportunities due to slow decision-making
- Significant financial risk from incomplete analysis
